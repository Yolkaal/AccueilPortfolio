            <h1>Who I Am</h1>
            <p>
                I am a passionate and creative apprentice developer with a strong "dreamer" mindset.
                I love building experiences from scratch, exploring ideas, and seeing them come to life through code and design.
                I enjoy taking full ownership of my projects and pushing myself to make things both functional and enjoyable.
            </p>

            <p>
                Most of my work is driven by personal projects, where I can combine autonomy, attention to detail, and curiosity.
                I aim to be versatile as a developer, learning every aspect of creation from gameplay systems to 3D assets, and one day, I hope to create my own studio where I can keep exploring and building everything I’m passionate about.
            </p>

            <h1>My Path</h1>
            <p>
                I studied Mathematics and NSI in high school, then joined the Computer Science program at the University of Montpellier.
                I also started learning Unity back in middle school, which sparked my long-lasting passion for game development.
            </p>

            <h1>My Main Skills</h1>
            <p>
                Most of my skills come from personal projects and long-term experimentation.
                I enjoy building things properly and improving them over time.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Unity / C#</strong> - My main development environment.
                    I use it to design gameplay systems, tools, and prototypes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Java</strong> - Mostly used for Minecraft modding and academic projects,
                    such as a first-year project where I implemented the Pokémon TCG.
                    It helped me develop a solid understanding of object-oriented programming and larger codebases.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Blender</strong> - Used to create or adjust assets for my projects or for 3D printing.
                    I Started learning it because of my will to make game with an artistic direction that differs from realism.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Optimization & clean architecture</strong> - Something I care deeply about.
                    I enjoy writing maintainable code that can evolve over time without becoming painful to refactor because I hate wasting time on things that could have been done properly the first time.
                </li>

            <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
            <p>
                Most of my hobbies are connected to creativity, game design, or technical curiosity.
                They often influence the way I approach my projects.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Sim racing and competitive multiplayer games, for the technical and skill-based aspect</li>
                <li>RPGs and narrative games, for world-building and storytelling inspiration</li>
                <li>Cooking, as another form of experimentation and creativity</li>
                <li>Cosplaying and 3D printing, combining design, fabrication, and problem-solving</li>
                <li>Photography and drawing, a way for me to express more my others passions</li>
                <li>3D modeling and music, as creative outlets alongside development</li>

            <h1>Note About AI</h1>
            <p>
                I HATE AI… nah, I’m joking.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is actually a very important topic for me.
                I’ve seen many friends fail their first year because they relied too much on AI, and I wasn’t far from making the same mistake.
            </p>
            <p>
                AI is not a substitute for our work. For me, it should help with understanding and learning.
                When you let the tool do all the work, you gain nothing from it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Personally, I only use AI in specific cases, such as summarizing documentation or very large log files,
                or to better understand how to write higher-quality code.
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, I’ve used it recently to learn how to apply design patterns to my Unity projects or also to summarize documentation for installing Nobara OS.
