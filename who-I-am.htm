                <h1>Who I Am</h1>
                <p>
                    I am a passionate and creative apprentice developer with a strong "dreamer" mindset.
                    I love building experiences from scratch, exploring ideas, and seeing them come to life through code and design.
                    I enjoy taking full ownership of my projects and pushing myself to make things both functional and enjoyable.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Most of my work is driven by personal projects, where I can combine autonomy, attention to detail, and curiosity.
                    I aim to be versatile as a developer, learning every aspect of creation from gameplay systems to 3D assets, and one day, I hope to create my own studio where I can keep exploring and building everything I’m passionate about.

                <h1>My Path</h1>
                <p>
                    I studied Mathematics and NSI in high school, then joined the Computer Science program at the University of Montpellier.
                    I also started learning Unity back in middle school, which sparked my long-lasting passion for game development.

                <h1>My Main Skills</h1>
                <p>
                    Most of my skills come from personal projects and long-term experimentation.
                    I enjoy building things properly and improving them over time.
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Unity / C#</strong> - My main development environment.
                        I use it to design gameplay systems, tools, and prototypes.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Java</strong> - Mostly used for Minecraft modding and academic projects,
                        such as a first-year project where I implemented the Pokémon TCG.
                        It helped me develop a solid understanding of object-oriented programming and larger codebases.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Blender</strong> - Used to create or adjust assets for my projects or for 3D printing.
                        I Started learning it because of my will to make game with an artistic direction that differs from realism.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Optimization & clean architecture</strong> - Something I care deeply about.
                        I enjoy writing maintainable code that can evolve over time without becoming painful to refactor because I hate wasting time on things that could have been done properly the first time.

                    Most of my hobbies are connected to creativity, game design, or technical curiosity.
                    They often influence the way I approach my projects.

                <h1>Note About AI</h1>
                <p>
                    I HATE AI… nah, I’m joking.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is actually a very important topic for me.
                    I’ve seen many friends fail their first year because they relied too much on AI, and I wasn’t far from making the same mistake.
                </p>
                <p>
                    AI is not a substitute for our work. For me, it should help with understanding and learning.
                    When you let the tool do all the work, you gain nothing from it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Personally, I only use AI in specific cases, such as summarizing documentation or very large log files,
                    or to better understand how to write higher-quality code.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, I’ve used it recently to learn how to apply design patterns to my Unity projects or also to summarize documentation for installing Nobara OS.
